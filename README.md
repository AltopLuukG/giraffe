This repository contains Giraffe, a React-based visualization library used to implement the [InfluxDB 2.0](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/) UI.

**This library is currently in a pre-alpha state.**
Docs will follow as soon as the API has a chance to stabilize.

## ðŸ¦’ Features

There exist plenty of terrific visualization libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem.
Giraffe aims to distinguish itself with several features:

- A high-level [_Grammar of Graphics_](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf) style API that can specify a wide variety of visualizations with a few simple concepts
- A [columnar](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/manipulating-flat-arrays) interface for input data that enables efficient interop with Web Workers and [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)
- Easy reactivity and extensibility via React
- Self-contained configs in the style of [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
- Support for mapping groupings of columns to a single visual aesthetic
