/*
  Check whether two objects are equal, where equality is defined as meeting all
  of the following conditions:

  - The two objects must have the exact same keys
  - If the value for a key is an array, every item in that array must be
    shallow equal (i.e. `===`) in both objects
  - If the value for a key is not an array, it must be shallow equal in both
    objects

  This function is designed for a very particular use case where we don't need
  to check for the true deep equality of two objects, but shallow equality
  checking is insufficient.
